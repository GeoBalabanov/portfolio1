              <h4>Future-Oriented Organization</h4>
              <p>Let's talk about organization. Since I was young my organization is on a top tier level. Even here in the Netherlands, I'm capable to organize my work very well. One of my passions through the years was to be the organizer of the group projects. I have the blessing to have a very good work rate under pressure. Always trying to be ahead of the time and the schedules is the thing that keeps me confident.</p>
              
              <p>Other thing I like to do is organizing the work and the task for everyone in the group, so everything will be equal and well-structured. </p>
              
              <p>At this point of my journey one thing is clear. I won't stop developing and improving my work individually and with others, because that's what makes me feel happy. I have a feeling that I'm on the right place at the right time</p>
