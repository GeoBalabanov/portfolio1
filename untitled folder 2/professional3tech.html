              <h4>Interactive Prototypes</h4>
              <p>The prototypes and the designs were the thing that I enjoyed a lot during the orienting phase and now in the media, they are becoming way more funnier and interesting to do. We have a lot of options and crearive ideas to work on everyday. The resourses are literally unlimited.</p>
              
              <p>For me to do a little sketch or the whole prototype for some of the projects is not a struggle at all and it's not overwhelming. That is basically what I like to do. The prototypes are also really helpful for us and our group projects, because with them we are exchanging the thoughts and ideas we have.</p>
              
              <p>>When we started the housing website with my group, I did a lot of researches to make sure that the prototype will be friendly to the clientele and most importantly, we have to like our product, because if we don't like what we did nobody is going to like and use it.</p>
